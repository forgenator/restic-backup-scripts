# restic-backup-scripts
Script to help with my restic backups.

1. Backup everything with restic, either via folder in the same machine, or via rest interface.
2. Copy restic backup folder to remote repository with rclone.

Something to think:
- How does rclone work if backup is happening via restic
- For now, let's just leave enough time between them.
